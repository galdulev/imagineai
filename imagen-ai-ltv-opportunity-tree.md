## Framework: Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery

This OST follows Teresa Torres' methodology from "Continuous Discovery Habits":
- **Outcome**: Business goal we want to achieve
- **Opportunities**: Customer needs, pain points, desires (NOT solutions)
- **Solutions**: Ideas that address opportunities
- **Experiments**: Tests to validate solutions will work

## 🎯 OUTCOME

**Increase photographer customer Lifetime Value (LTV) by 40%**

- Current estimated LTV: ~$1,200 (avg 2.5 years × $40/month)
- Target LTV: $1,680
- Timeframe: 12-18 months

### Why this outcome?
- Acquisition costs are high in photography market
- Existing customers already trust the product

## 💡 OPPORTUNITIES

Opportunities are framed as **customer needs, pain points, and desires** discovered through research of 52 photographer problems across Wedding, Event, and Portrait segments.

### Opportunity 1: "I waste hours on tasks Imagen doesn't help with"

**Customer verbatim:** "Imagen saves me so much time on editing, but then I spend hours on albums, galleries, and invoicing. I wish it did more."

**Evidence:**
- 66% of photographer workflow problems remain unsolved
- Photographers use 3-5 additional tools alongside Imagen
- Post-editing tasks take 10-15 hours per job
- Top unsolved: Album design (3-6 hrs), Gallery delivery (30-60 min), Payment chasing (ongoing)

**Segments affected:** All (Wedding, Event, Portrait)

### Opportunity 2: "I can't deliver photos fast enough for my clients"

**Customer verbatim:** "Corporate clients want photos within 24 hours. Even with Imagen editing, I can't tag, organize, and deliver that fast."

**Evidence:**

**Evidence:**
- 95% of wedding photographers offer albums
- Album design takes 3-6 hours per wedding
- Revision cycles add 1-2 more hours
- Photos already in Imagen after editing - natural extension

**Segments affected:** Primarily Wedding

### Opportunity 4: "My portrait retouching still takes forever"

- Total retouching time: 6-33 hours per session
- Clients expect Instagram-level retouching

**Segments affected:** All

### Opportunity 7: "I can't keep up during busy season"

**Customer verbatim:** "May through October I'm drowning. I shoot every weekend and editing stacks up. I need to work faster or I'll burn out."

- Burnout is #1 reason photographers leave industry

**Segments affected:** All, especially Wedding and Portrait

## 🔑 KEY PRINCIPLES (Teresa Torres)

1. **Opportunities are not solutions** - We framed opportunities as customer needs ("I waste hours...") not features ("Build a gallery")

2. **Multiple solutions per opportunity** - Each opportunity has 3-4 potential solutions to explore

3. **Validate before building** - Experiments test assumptions before major investment

4. **Stay outcome-focused** - Everything ties back to the +40% LTV goal

5. **Continuous discovery** - This tree should be updated weekly as we learn from experiments
