===== SECTION: RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES =====

FOR D3: Willingness to Pay
Strategy 1: Bundle with subscription (basic free)
Strategy 2: Transaction fee only (no subscription increase)
Strategy 3: Freemium model (free tier drives adoption)
Strategy 4: Competitive pricing (match or beat Pixieset)

FOR D2: Pain High Enough to Switch
Strategy 1: Migration tools (make switching easy)
Strategy 2: Parallel use (allow both during transition)
Strategy 3: Incentives (free months for switchers)
Strategy 4: Superior integration (workflow so good can't resist)

FOR U2: Seamless Workflow
Strategy 1: Extensive UX testing (test early, often)
Strategy 2: Photographer co-design (involve users)
Strategy 3: Gradual rollout (beta → soft → full)
Strategy 4: Rapid iteration (fix issues quickly)

===== SECTION: KEY TAKEAWAYS =====

WHAT WE KNOW:
✅ Editing pain is solved (1,526 reviews)
✅ Post-delivery is fragmented (story analysis)
✅ Integration is valued (interviews)
✅ Technical feasibility likely (team assessment)

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW (Must Validate):
❓ Will they pay? (Critical unknown)
❓ Will they switch? (High-risk assumption)
❓ Is our UX good enough? (Must test vs Pixieset)
❓ Will it increase retention? (Can only validate in beta)

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
Week 1: Launch fake door test + pricing survey
Week 2: Conduct 10 user interviews
Week 3: Complete technical POC + go/no-go decision
Week 4-6: Design sprint + usability testing
Week 7-12: Beta launch + validation
