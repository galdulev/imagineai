# Prioritization Framework: Problems & Areas to Focus On

## Strategic Context

**The Focus**: CLIENT-FACING delivery - "Be where their clients are"

**Key Insights from Research**:
- 89% of mobile jobs-to-be-done are for marketing or client communication
- 100% of interviewees prefer desktop for photo editing (even when traveling)
- 80% of web visits are from desktop (not mobile)
- Photographers leave Imagen AI after editing to use other tools for delivery, gallery, and client communication
- Average 3-7 tools per wedding workflow
- The opportunity is NOT photographer mobile editing, but being where CLIENTS are (mobile)

**Strategic Hypothesis**: The opportunity may not be unlocking photographer mobile use, but being where their clients are—on mobile devices.

## Problems & Areas to Prioritize

### Category 1: Problems from Qualitative Insights (8 themes)

1. **Gallery & Album Segmentation**
   - Pain Point: Manual Workflow
   - Quote: "Segment each step in the galleries and albums manually is a nightmare."
   - Impact: Time-consuming manual categorization creates workflow friction and delays delivery

2. **Client Communication Overload**
   - Pain Point: Request Management
   - Quote: "Clients and guests immediately start bombarding me with requests."
   - Impact: Overwhelming volume of requests creates stress and reduces time for core work

3. **Mobile-First Client Expectations**
   - Pain Point: Platform Mismatch
   - Quote: "Everyone wants the photos on their phone"
   - Impact: Desktop-focused tools don't meet client expectations for mobile access and sharing

4. **Upselling & Revenue Generation**
   - Pain Point: Sales Friction
   - Quote: "I don't know how to upsell stuff after, it's embarrassing"
   - Impact: Lack of tools and confidence prevents photographers from maximizing revenue opportunities

5. **Dual Role: Photographer & Marketer**
   - Pain Point: Role Expansion
   - Quote: "I work as a marketer as much as I shoot if not more"
   - Impact: Photographers spend equal or more time on marketing than shooting, reducing focus on creative work

6. **Manual Gallery Segmentation** (duplicate/related to #1)
   - Pain Point: Manual Workflow
   - Quote: "Segmenting each step in galleries manually is a nightmare."
   - Impact: Time-consuming manual process creates workflow bottlenecks and delays client delivery

7. **File Transfer Friction**
   - Pain Point: Workflow Inefficiency
   - Quote: "I download the edited photos, then upload it again to dropbox to share with clients"
   - Impact: Redundant download-upload cycles waste time and create unnecessary workflow steps

8. **Multi-Photographer Collaboration**
   - Pain Point: Coordination Complexity
   - Quote: "I often work with multiple photographers and syncing one segmentation and the wetransfer links is super time consuming"
   - Impact: Manual synchronization across team members creates coordination overhead and increases project management time

## Prioritization Framework

### Framework: 2x2 Matrix

**X-Axis: Client-Facing Impact** (Low → High)
- Does this problem/area directly involve clients?
- Do clients interact with this part of the workflow?
- Is this where clients experience the photographer's work?

**Y-Axis: Strategic Leverage** (Low → High)
- Does solving this prevent churn? (Do photographers leave Imagen for this?)
- Can we build an unfair advantage here? (e.g., vs Dropbox)
- Does this expand our share of workflow?
- Does this create a strategic moat?

### Quadrants

**Top Right (P0 - Highest Priority)**: High Client-Facing + High Strategic Leverage
- Directly client-facing AND causes churn/creates strategic advantage

**Top Left (P1)**: Low Client-Facing + High Strategic Leverage
- Internal workflow optimizations that prevent churn or create advantage

**Bottom Right (P2)**: High Client-Facing + Low Strategic Leverage
- Client-facing but doesn't prevent churn or create strong moat

**Bottom Left (P3 - Lowest Priority)**: Low Client-Facing + Low Strategic Leverage
- Internal optimizations with lower strategic value

## Ranking Analysis

### P0: Highest Priority (High Client-Facing + High Strategic Leverage)

#### 1. **Delivery** (Area)
**Client-Facing Impact: 10/10**
- Clients directly interact with galleries and photo delivery
- This is the final touchpoint where clients experience the photographer's work
- "Everyone wants the photos on their phone" - direct client expectation

**Strategic Leverage: 10/10**
- **Churn Impact**: Photographers leave Imagen after editing to use Pixieset, Pic-Time, Dropbox
- **Strategic Moat**: Can build unfair advantage vs Dropbox (mentioned in focus: "sorry not sorry, dropbox")
- **Workflow Expansion**: Currently photographers exit Imagen ecosystem here - solving this keeps them in
- **Data**: "Photographers leave Imagen AI after editing to use other tools for delivery, gallery, and client communication"

**Problems Included**:
- Gallery & Album Segmentation (manual workflow)
- File Transfer Friction (download/upload to Dropbox)
- Mobile-First Client Expectations (platform mismatch)

**Jobs-to-Be-Done**:
- Job 19: Send gallery link in WhatsApp
- Job 22: Track client engagement with gallery

**Rationale**: This is THE exit point. Solving delivery keeps photographers in the ecosystem AND directly serves clients where they are (mobile). Highest strategic value.

---

#### 2. **Client Communication** (Area/Problem Cluster)
**Client-Facing Impact: 10/10**
- Direct client interaction throughout workflow
- Clients communicate via WhatsApp, email, phone
- "Clients and guests immediately start bombarding me with requests"

**Strategic Leverage: 9/10**
- **Churn Impact**: High - photographers use separate tools (WhatsApp, email, phone)
- **Workflow Expansion**: 89% of mobile jobs are marketing/client communication
- **Mobile-First**: Happens where clients are (mobile devices)
- **Strategic Moat**: Medium - communication tools are fragmented, but less defensible than delivery

**Problems Included**:
- Client Communication Overload (request management)
- Mobile-First Client Expectations (platform mismatch - part of delivery too)

**Jobs-to-Be-Done**:
- Job 11: Communicate with clients on WhatsApp
- Job 20: Communicate with client during wedding day
- Job 21: Notify client when gallery is ready

**Rationale**: Directly client-facing, happens on mobile (where clients are), represents 89% of mobile jobs. High strategic value but slightly lower than delivery because it's less of an exit point.

---

### P1: High Priority (High Client-Facing + Medium Strategic Leverage OR Medium Client-Facing + High Strategic Leverage)

#### 3. **Marketing** (Area)
**Client-Facing Impact: 8/10**
- Clients see marketing content (Instagram, social media)
- Clients discover photographers through marketing
- "I work as a marketer as much as I shoot if not more"

**Strategic Leverage: 7/10**
- **Churn Impact**: Medium - photographers use Instagram, separate tools, but don't necessarily leave Imagen for this
- **Workflow Expansion**: 6 marketing jobs (Job 23-28)
- **Strategic Moat**: Lower - Instagram is the platform, hard to build moat
- **Revenue Impact**: Medium - helps get new clients but doesn't prevent churn

**Problems Included**:
- Dual Role: Photographer & Marketer (role expansion)

**Jobs-to-Be-Done**:
- Job 23: Post to Instagram (photos)
- Job 24: Post Instagram Reels
- Job 25: Get more clients through social media
- Job 26: Share behind-the-scenes content
- Job 27: Tag clients in posts
- Job 28: Schedule social media posts

**Rationale**: Client-facing (clients see the content), but lower strategic leverage because it doesn't prevent churn and Instagram is the platform (hard to build moat). Still important because it's 6 of 34 mobile jobs.

---

#### 4. **Upsell & Retain** (Area)
**Client-Facing Impact: 9/10**
- Direct client interaction for additional sales
- Clients make purchasing decisions here

**Strategic Leverage: 8/10**
- **Revenue Impact**: High - "I don't know how to upsell stuff after, it's embarrassing"
- **Churn Impact**: Medium - doesn't cause churn but missed revenue opportunity
- **Strategic Moat**: Medium - can build tools that make upselling easier

**Problems Included**:
- Upselling & Revenue Generation (sales friction)

**Rationale**: High client-facing (direct sales interaction) and high revenue impact, but doesn't prevent churn. Strategic value in revenue expansion.

---

### P2: Medium Priority (High Client-Facing + Low Strategic Leverage)

#### 5. **Multi-Photographer Collaboration** (Problem)
**Client-Facing Impact: 6/10**
- Indirect - affects delivery quality/timing which clients experience
- Clients don't directly interact with this

**Strategic Leverage: 5/10**
- **Churn Impact**: Low - doesn't cause photographers to leave Imagen
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Medium - saves time but not a churn driver
- **Strategic Moat**: Low - coordination tools exist, not a differentiator

**Problems Included**:
- Multi-Photographer Collaboration (coordination complexity)

**Rationale**: Lower client-facing (indirect impact) and lower strategic leverage. Important for workflow efficiency but not a churn driver or strategic moat.

---

### P3: Lower Priority (Low Client-Facing + Low Strategic Leverage)

#### 6. **Lead & Book** (Area)
**Client-Facing Impact: 7/10**
- Clients interact during booking process
- First touchpoint with clients

**Strategic Leverage: 4/10**
- **Churn Impact**: Very Low - photographers don't leave Imagen for this (happens before they use Imagen)
- **Workflow Expansion**: Low - happens before editing workflow
- **Strategic Moat**: Low - many CRM tools exist (HoneyBook, Studio Ninja)

**Jobs-to-Be-Done**:
- Job 11: Communicate with clients on WhatsApp (overlaps with Client Communication)
- Job 12: Get paid / collect payments
- Job 13: Put wedding date on calendar
- Job 14: Impress the lead I get
- Job 15: Respond to inquiries quickly
- Job 16: Send contracts for signature
- Job 17: Track payment status
- Job 18: Manage client questionnaires

**Rationale**: Client-facing but happens BEFORE photographers use Imagen. Low strategic leverage because it doesn't prevent churn (they haven't started using Imagen yet) and many tools exist.

---

#### 7. **Payments** (Area)
**Client-Facing Impact: 6/10**
- Clients pay, but payment collection is photographer-facing
- Indirect client experience

**Strategic Leverage: 3/10**
- **Churn Impact**: Very Low - doesn't cause churn
- **Workflow Expansion**: Low - many payment tools exist
- **Strategic Moat**: Very Low - Stripe, banks, etc. are the infrastructure

**Jobs-to-Be-Done**:
- Job 12: Get paid / collect payments
- Job 17: Track payment status

**Rationale**: Lower client-facing (indirect) and very low strategic leverage. Many payment solutions exist, not a differentiator.

## Key Insights for Prioritization

1. **Delivery is THE priority** - It's the exit point, directly client-facing, and has strategic moat potential vs Dropbox

2. **Client-facing = Mobile** - 89% of mobile jobs are client communication/marketing. The opportunity is being where clients are (mobile), not photographer mobile editing.

3. **Churn prevention > Revenue expansion** - Solving delivery prevents churn (photographers leaving). Upselling expands revenue but doesn't prevent churn.

4. **Strategic moat matters** - Delivery has moat potential (vs Dropbox). Marketing has lower moat (Instagram is the platform).

5. **Timing matters** - Lead & Book happens before Imagen usage, so lower priority. Delivery happens after editing (exit point), so highest priority.

## Questions to Consider

1. Should we combine "Gallery & Album Segmentation" and "Manual Gallery Segmentation" as one problem?
2. Should "Mobile-First Client Expectations" be part of Delivery or Client Communication?
3. How do we weight "prevent churn" vs "expand revenue" in strategic leverage?
4. Should we prioritize by "jobs-to-be-done count" or "strategic impact"?
5. How do we visualize this in the slide - 2x2 matrix, ranked list, or both?
