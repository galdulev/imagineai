   - Not just "photographer sees activity"
   - "Brings users back" - retention mechanism
   - Works for both photographers AND clients

## Visual Considerations

1. **Color coding:**

   - "V1.1" features: Purple (future foundation)
   - Long-term vision: Gradient progression

2. **Layout:**
   - Two-column for "Now" vs "V1.1"
   - Or timeline flow showing progression
   - Keep long-term vision at bottom

3. **Emphasis:**
   - Viral Loop should be prominent (huge differentiator)
   - Client Favorites dual purpose should be clear
   - Engagement Notifications as "hooks" not just "notifications"

## Questions to Consider

1. Should "Cloud Upsell" be a separate feature or part of Deliver stage?
2. How prominent should the viral loop be? (It's a huge differentiator)
3. Should we keep the conditional "If 6-month evaluation validates" or make it more confident?
4. How to visually show the dual purpose of Client Favorites?
5. Should Engagement Notifications be positioned as retention mechanism or feature?

---

## Final Recommendation

**Structure:**
- Title: "Path to Upsell Stage" (remove conditional, make confident)
- Two main sections: "Immediate Value" and "V1.1 Foundation"
- Keep long-term vision progression

**Key Messages:**
1. We're not waiting - Cloud Upsell and Viral Loop happen now
2. Client Favorites has dual value (monetization + data quality)
3. Engagement Notifications are retention hooks, not just notifications
4. Viral Loop is a huge differentiator (organic brand advocacy)

**Visual:**
- Clear separation between "Now" and "Future"
- Highlight viral loop as key differentiator
- Show Client Favorites dual purpose clearly
- Keep progression timeline at bottom
