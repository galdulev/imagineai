## Phase 2: Opportunity Prioritization

*Based on Research Methodology from Next Capability Research Plan*  
*Framework: Teresa Torres Opportunity Solution Tree*  
*Date: December 5, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) synthesizes all discovery research to prioritize Imagen AI's next capability expansion. Following the Teresa Torres methodology, we start with the desired **outcome**, map **opportunities** (customer needs, not solutions), and only then explore **solutions** for the highest-priority opportunities.

**Outcome Goal:** Increase LTV by 40% by becoming the photographer's one-stop shop.

**Top Priority Opportunity:** "I waste hours on delivery and client management after editing is done."

#### Solution A: Integrated Gallery + Payment Hub (RECOMMENDED)

**Description:** Build a native gallery delivery system with integrated payment processing, creating a seamless edit → deliver → pay workflow.

**Core Features:**
1. One-click gallery creation from edited photos
2. Branded client galleries with custom domain
3. Integrated payment processing (Stripe Connect)
4. Gallery access tied to payment status
5. Automated payment reminders
6. Client engagement tracking

**Why This Solution:**
- Highest impact on user pain
- Creates strongest competitive moat
- Enables future upsell capabilities
- Aligns with "one-stop shop" vision

**Risks:**
- High development effort
- Requires payment infrastructure
- Competing with established players

#### Solution B: Partner with Existing Galleries (FALLBACK)

**Description:** Deep integration with Pixieset, ShootProof, or Pic-Time to enable one-click export from Imagen AI.

**Why Fallback:**
- Lower effort but lower impact
- No competitive moat (integration can be replicated)
- Still fragmented experience
- Revenue share with partners

#### Solution C: API to Existing Galleries (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Description:** Simple API export to user's existing gallery platform.

**Why Not Recommended:**
- Minimal user value
- No differentiation
- No revenue opportunity
- Doesn't solve the core problem

## Key Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Build vs. Partner for Galleries

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Build** | Full control, moat, revenue | High effort, time | ✅ Recommended |
| **Partner** | Faster, lower risk | No moat, revenue share | Fallback |

**Decision Needed:** Commit to building native gallery delivery.

### Decision 2: Payment Processing Partner

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Stripe Connect** | Best-in-class, trusted | 2.9% + 30¢ fees | ✅ Recommended |
| **Square** | Good alternative | Less flexible | Fallback |
| **Custom** | Lower fees | High effort, risk | Not recommended |

**Decision Needed:** Commit to Stripe Connect partnership.

### Decision 3: Pricing Model

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Included in subscription** | Adoption driver | No incremental revenue | ✅ For gallery |
| **Transaction fee** | Revenue stream | May reduce adoption | ✅ For payments |
| **Separate tier** | Clear value | Complexity | For Phase 3+ |

**Decision Needed:** Include gallery in subscription, charge transaction fee on payments.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Low adoption** | Medium | High | Beta program, migration tools |
| **Payment complexity** | Medium | Medium | Start with Stripe only |
