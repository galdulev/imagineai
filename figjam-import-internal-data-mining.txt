- "I didn't know I needed this until I had it"

INSIGHT 3: Retention is Emotional, Not Functional
- Strongest drivers are emotional (life-changing)
- Expanding into post-delivery = new emotional connections
- Each capability increases switching costs

- 90% of images need no adjustment
- 10% creates disproportionate frustration
- Better to expand horizontally than vertically
