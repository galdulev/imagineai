**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

I'm new to Imagen and was having trouble with the culling software which resulted in me paying for over 2k images that I didn't end up delivering to my clients. Max listened to my issues let me show him what happened and then resolved the issue immediately.

#### Owl Eye Photography (CA) - Nov 25, 2025
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**Title:** Supportive and Efficient

Max has been a huge help with me this week on being able to accommodate needs to help me get my projects in. The meet ups that Scott put on are amazing and helpful to understand what changes and shape Imagen is taking, I do find its a much nicer breeze working through my galleries after they have been culled and edited with the few minor tweaks. Its honestly so amazing. I really appreciate the integrations and the easy breezy experience now, its taken a year to figure out how to properly structure it and I can only imagen itll get better :)

*Company replied: Thank you so much for sharing this! We're happy to hear that Max and Scott are making everything easier as you get started with Imagen. We're grateful to be part of your process, and we're always here to help!*

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**Title:** Imagen is a total life saver!

Imagen is a total life saver. I'm a photographer based in Brazil and ever since I've started using Imagen, my company has expanded so much. It saves me so much time in editing....and yes, it's way better than Aftershoot when it comes to editing.

*Company replied: Thank you so much, Vinicius! We're thrilled to hear how much Imagen has supported your company's growth and helped streamline your editing workflow.*

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Alex spent over an hour helping me figure out an issue with a corrupt catalogue in Lightroom. They were patient and very concise with describing and suggesting next steps. Imagen customer support has been wonderful and I'm so glad I made the switch!

#### Jorge de Araujo - Nov 20, 2025
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Imagen has completely changed my workflow. A four hour event shoot used to take me 2–3 hours to process in Lightroom. Now the entire process from upload to delivery takes about 45 minutes. The actual editing is great and very close to my style with minimal tweaking needed.

#### Ashley Warren (US) - Nov 24, 2025
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**Title:** Imagen has changed my life

Imagen has changed my life! I've been a professional photographer for 13 years. Culling has been a constant bottleneck for me and finding consistency in my editing an ongoing roller coaster. Imagen has revolutionized both for me! I've utilized the editing AI for 2 years now and I'm delivering galleries faster than ever, which in turn increases my gross sales by allowing me to work with more clients. The culling software has made culling weddings and family sessions SO much easier! I highly recommend this software for any professional looking to streamline their business processes.

*Company replied: Thank you so much for sharing this, Ashley! We love knowing that both the editing AI and culling tools have made such a difference for your business. It truly means the world to us!*

I'm just getting started with Imagen AI, and the customer service has been absolutely amazing!

They've made the learning process so much easier and less intimidating.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Imagen saves me dozens of hours per month, and is undetectable as an AI service. Its one of those tools that is perfectly executed. By interacting with the tool vs editing the actual file, it solves a lot of the problems other AI services have. The team is also very responsive and helpful.
