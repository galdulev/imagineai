## Executive Summary

2. Analyzing user segmentation to identify our core focus

## The Business Goal: From "Tool" to "Operating System"

### Our Mission & Promise

**Vision:** We envision a world where technology handles the tedious, so photographers can focus on the timeless.

**Mission:** "To give photographers their time back - by building a product that works the way they do, thinks the way they think, and protects what makes their art uniquely theirs."

**Promise:** "Letting you focus on what you Love" — Beautiful photos without hours of tedious logistics, editing, culling.

### The Strategic Shift

Our business goal is not just to sell more edits. It is to **maximize Share of Workflow**.

**Current State:** Imagen AI is a powerful tool that photographers use for specific tasks (culling & editing).

**Target State:** Imagen AI becomes the **operating system** for photographers' entire workflow—from first client inquiry to final delivery and beyond.

### Why "Share of Workflow" Matters

1. **Retention:** The more of a photographer's workflow we own, the harder it is to switch
2. **Revenue:** More touchpoints = more opportunities for value creation and monetization
3. **Differentiation:** Competitors can copy features, but they can't copy deep workflow integration
4. **Mission Alignment:** "Photographers one-stop-shop" requires owning more than just editing

## Why Professional Photographers?

### Strategic Justification

#### 1. Mission Alignment: "Photographers One-Stop-Shop"

Our mission explicitly states we're building for **photographers**. Not editing services, not agencies, not consumers—**photographers**.

- **Mission Clarity:** "Photographers one-stop-shop" means we serve the end user (the photographer), not intermediaries
- **Workflow Ownership:** Professional photographers have the most complete, end-to-end workflow we can own
- **Relationship Depth:** We build relationships with the decision-maker, not a procurement department

#### 2. They Are Our Core Users

**Evidence:**
- 60-70% of current user base are professional photographers
- Highest engagement and retention rates

- Most vocal advocates and product champions

**Business Impact:**
- Largest addressable market within our current user base
- Highest lifetime value (LTV)
- Best product-market fit validation
- Strongest foundation for expansion

#### 3. Workflow Complexity = Opportunity

Professional photographers have the most complex, multi-step workflows:
- Pre-shoot: Booking, contracts, consultations, planning
- Shoot day: Multiple locations, equipment management, client interaction
- Post-production: Import, culling, editing, retouching, export
- Delivery: Gallery creation, client communication, payment
- Post-delivery: Upsells, albums, prints, client retention

**Each step is an opportunity to increase Share of Workflow.**

#### 4. Revenue Potential

Professional photographers:
- **High willingness to pay:** Photography is their livelihood
- **Recurring usage:** Multiple shoots per month = consistent revenue
- **Upsell potential:** Albums, prints, additional services
- **Network effects:** Each photographer can bring in clients (gallery delivery, booking)

#### 5. Strategic Moat Building

By focusing on professional photographers:
- **Deep integration:** We can build features that require understanding their entire business
- **Switching costs:** The more workflow we own, the harder to leave
- **Data advantage:** We understand their business better than anyone
- **Community:** Professional photographers form communities—we become the platform
