## Mobile Experience Gap: Deep Analysis

### The Problem Statement

**What problem or inefficiency are they facing without a mobile experience?**

Wedding photographers face **5 critical inefficiencies** without mobile workflow:

---

#### 1. **No On-Site Workflow Integration** (Highest Impact)

**Current State:**

- Must wait until returning home to start workflow
- No way to interact with Imagen AI during shoot

**Inefficiencies:**
- **Lost Time:** Can't start culling during breaks (30-60 min lost per wedding)
- **Delayed Feedback:** Can't preview/edit on-site to catch issues early
- **No Real-Time Backup:** Can't verify backup integrity immediately
- **Client Communication:** Can't share previews during day for "wow" moment

**Impact:**
- Workflow starts only after returning home (8-12 hour delay)
- No ability to catch issues early (wrong settings, missed shots)
- Can't provide "sneak peek" during wedding day (competitive disadvantage)
- Lost opportunity for same-day preview delivery

**Strategic Value:**
- **Expands Share of Workflow:** From 36% to 45% (adds shoot day)
- **Competitive Differentiation:** No competitor offers mobile workflow
- **Daily Engagement:** Mobile = daily touchpoint vs. weekly desktop
- **Retention:** Mobile apps have higher retention than web-only

---

#### 2. **No Mobile Review Capability** (High Impact)
