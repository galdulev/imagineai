# Mobile Use Cases & Moments - Planning Document

## Objective
Clarify the use cases and specific moments when photographers would use mobile delivery, and create a slide for new behaviors/segments enabled.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have Covered:
1. **User Journey Deep Dive** (Slide 11.5.5) - Shows DELIVER stage but doesn't specify mobile moments
2. **MVP Scope** (Slide 12.22) - Shows features but not when/where they'd be used
3. **Ecosystem Fit** (Slide 12.23) - Shows workflow but not mobile-specific contexts
4. **Moment of Truth** (Slide 11.5.5) - Mentions "after editing, at the export step" but doesn't specify mobile context

### What's Missing:
1. **Specific moments/contexts** when mobile delivery is needed:
   - After wedding shoot (in car, on way home)
   - Between events (quick turnaround needed)
   - On the train/commute
   - Away from desktop
   - Client requests while photographer is mobile

2. **Explicit problem statement** without mobile:
   - "Photographers must wait until they're at their desktop to deliver"
   - "Creates delays in client communication"
   - "Missed opportunities for quick turnarounds"

3. **New behaviors enabled** by mobile:
   - Deliver on-the-go
   - Share sneak peeks immediately
   - Respond to client requests in real-time
   - Quick turnaround between events

4. **New segments enabled**:
   - Mobile-first photographers
   - Part-time photographers who work from mobile
   - Photographers who travel frequently
   - Photographers who need quick turnarounds

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Enhance User Journey Deep Dive (Slide 11.5.5)
**Location:** After "6. DELIVER (Future)" section

**Add:**
- **Mobile Moments Section:**
  - After wedding shoot (in car, on way home) - "Share sneak peek while driving home"
  - Between events (quick turnaround) - "Deliver Event 1 while traveling to Event 2"
  - On the train/commute - "Use commute time productively"
  - Client requests - "Respond to urgent client requests immediately"
  - Away from desktop - "No need to wait until you're back at your computer"

### 2. Enhance MVP Scope (Slide 12.22)
**Add subsection:** "When & Where Mobile Delivery Matters"

**Content:**
- **Problem Without Mobile:**
  - Photographers must wait until they're at their desktop
  - Creates delays in client communication
  - Missed opportunities for quick turnarounds
  - Can't respond to urgent client requests while mobile

- **Solution With Mobile:**
  - Deliver immediately after editing (even if away from desktop)
  - Share sneak peeks on the go
  - Respond to client requests in real-time
  - Use commute/travel time productively

### 3. New Slide: "New Behaviors & Segments Enabled" (Slide 12.23.5)
**Location:** After Ecosystem Fit (Slide 12.23), before Strategic Impact (Slide 12.24)

**Structure:**

#### Title: "New Behaviors & Segments Enabled"

**Section 1: New Behaviors Enabled**
- **Deliver On-the-Go**
  - Photographers can deliver immediately after editing, even if away from desktop
  - No need to wait until they're back at their computer
  
- **Share Sneak Peeks Immediately**
  - Share previews while driving home from shoot
  - Build excitement and engagement with clients
  
- **Respond to Client Requests in Real-Time**
  - Answer urgent client questions while mobile
  - Share specific photos on demand
  
- **Quick Turnaround Between Events**
  - Deliver Event 1 while traveling to Event 2
  - Maximize productivity during travel time

**Section 2: New Segments Enabled**
- **Mobile-First Photographers**
  - Photographers who primarily work from mobile devices
  - Traveling photographers who don't have consistent desktop access
  
- **Part-Time Photographers**
  - Weekend warriors who work from mobile setups
  - Photographers who have day jobs and work from mobile
  
- **Quick Turnaround Specialists**
  - Event photographers who need same-day delivery
  - Photographers who compete on speed of delivery
  
- **Geographically Distributed Photographers**
  - Photographers who travel frequently
  - International photographers who work across time zones

**Section 3: Strategic Impact**
- **Expands Addressable Market**
  - Reaches photographers who couldn't use desktop-only solution
  - Enables new use cases and workflows
  
- **Increases Engagement**
  - More frequent touchpoints with platform
  - Mobile-first behavior creates stronger habit formation
  
- **Competitive Differentiation**
  - Only AI editing platform with mobile delivery
  - Unique value proposition for mobile-first photographers

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enhance User Journey Deep Dive
- Add "Mobile Moments" subsection after DELIVER stage
- Include specific contexts: after shoot, between events, on train, client requests

### Step 2: Enhance MVP Scope
- Add "When & Where Mobile Delivery Matters" section
- Explicitly state problem without mobile and solution with mobile

### Step 3: Create New Slide
- Create Slide 12.23.5: "New Behaviors & Segments Enabled"
- Include three sections: New Behaviors, New Segments, Strategic Impact
- Use visual design consistent with rest of deck

## Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **Mobile is not just convenience - it's enabling new use cases**
   - Without mobile: Must wait for desktop access
   - With mobile: Deliver immediately, anywhere

2. **Mobile unlocks new photographer segments**
   - Mobile-first photographers
   - Part-time photographers
   - Quick turnaround specialists

3. **Mobile creates new behaviors**
   - On-the-go delivery
   - Real-time client communication
   - Sneak peek sharing

4. **Strategic value beyond convenience**
   - Expands addressable market
   - Increases engagement frequency
   - Competitive differentiation

## Visual Design Considerations

- Use timeline/chronology for "moments" (after shoot → between events → on train)
- Use before/after comparison for problem/solution
- Use segment cards/icons for new segments enabled
- Use behavior flow diagrams for new behaviors
- Maintain consistent color scheme (accent for behaviors, success for segments)
