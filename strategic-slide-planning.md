# Strategic Slide Planning: Post-Opportunity Tree Analysis
## CPO Perspective on Deck Structure & Strategic Communication

---

## Context: Where We Are

**Current State:**
- ✅ Established the problem space (52 problems identified)
- ✅ Defined target users (Professional Photographers - High Priority)
- ✅ Mapped the complete workflow (9 stages, Imagen AI owns 2)
- ✅ Identified the strategic focus: **Own the Deliver Step**
- ✅ Rationalized why Delivery is the priority (6 strategic points)
- ✅ Mapped problems to opportunities via Teresa Torres Opportunity Tree

**Next Critical Question:** How do we evaluate and prioritize opportunities to build?

## Strategic Framework: Impact Model + Opportunity Mapping + Strategic Fit

### Slide 8.2: Impact Model + Opportunity Mapping + Strategic Fit

**Purpose:** Demonstrate rigorous product thinking and strategic alignment before committing to build.

**Why This Matters (CPO Lens):**
1. **Risk Mitigation:** Prevents building the wrong thing
2. **Resource Optimization:** Ensures we invest in highest-value opportunities
3. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Shows data-driven decision making
4. **Strategic Coherence:** Proves opportunities align with company vision

---

## Three-Dimensional Evaluation Framework

### Dimension 1: Impact Model
**Question:** What's the potential value if we solve this?

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **User Impact:** How many photographers does this affect? (Reach)
- **Pain Severity:** How much does this hurt? (Intensity)
- **Frequency:** How often does this problem occur? (Occurrence)
- **Time Savings:** Hours saved per wedding/workflow cycle
- **Revenue Impact:** Direct revenue (upsell) + Indirect (retention, expansion)

**Scoring Framework:**
- **High Impact (9-10):** Affects 80%+ of users, severe pain, daily occurrence, 5+ hours saved
- **Medium Impact (6-8):** Affects 40-80% of users, moderate pain, weekly occurrence, 1-5 hours saved
- **Low Impact (1-5):** Affects <40% of users, minor pain, occasional occurrence, <1 hour saved

**Example Opportunities to Evaluate:**
1. **AI-Powered Gallery Segmentation**
   - Impact: High (10/10)
   - Rationale: "Segmenting galleries manually is a nightmare" - affects 100% of photographers, saves 1-2 hours per wedding

2. **Mobile-First Client Gallery**
   - Impact: High (9/10)
   - Rationale: "Everyone wants photos on their phone" - directly addresses client-facing delivery

3. **Automated Face Recognition & Grouping**
   - Impact: Medium-High (8/10)
   - Rationale: Reduces manual organization, but not all photographers need this

### Dimension 2: Strategic Fit
**Question:** Does this opportunity align with our core strengths and vision?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

#### A. Vision & Mission Alignment
- **Vision:** "Technology handles the tedious, so photographers can focus on creating art"
- **Mission:** "Be where their clients are" (client-facing delivery focus)

**Scoring:**
- **High Fit (9-10):** Directly enables photographers to focus on art, client-facing
- **Medium Fit (6-8):** Supports the vision but not core to mission
- **Low Fit (1-5):** Misaligned or tangential to vision/mission

**Example Evaluation:**
- **Gallery Delivery:** High Fit (10/10) - Core to "be where clients are"
- **Client Communication:** High Fit (9/10) - Client-facing, reduces tedious work
- **Marketing Tools:** Medium Fit (6/10) - Supports business but not core delivery

#### B. AI Differentiation
**Question:** Can we solve this better with AI than competitors?

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **AI Advantage:** Does AI/ML provide unique value competitors can't match?
- **Data Moat:** Do we have proprietary data that improves the solution?
- **Learning Curve:** Can our AI learn and improve over time?
- **Competitive Moat:** How hard is it for competitors to replicate?

**Scoring:**
- **High Differentiation (9-10):** Unique AI capability, proprietary data, learning advantage
- **Medium Differentiation (6-8):** AI helps but not unique, some data advantage
- **Low Differentiation (1-5):** Little AI advantage, easily replicable

**Example Evaluation:**
- **AI Gallery Segmentation:** High Differentiation (10/10)
  - Can learn photographer preferences
  - Face recognition + scene understanding
  - Improves with each wedding
  - Competitors (Pixieset, Pic-Time) can't match

- **Payment Processing:** Low Differentiation (3/10)
  - Many solutions exist (Stripe, PayPal)
  - No AI advantage
  - Commoditized feature

#### C. Existing Capabilities Alignment

**1. Technical Capabilities**
- **Current Stack:** Cloud infrastructure, AI/ML pipeline, image processing
- **Gap Analysis:** What do we need to build vs. what we have?

**2. Data Assets**
- **What We Have:** Edited photos, photographer profiles, style data
- **What We Can Learn:** Gallery structures, client preferences, delivery patterns

**3. Brand & Market Position**
- **Brand Perception:** "AI editing leader" - can we extend to delivery?
- **User Trust:** Do photographers trust us beyond editing?
- **Market Position:** Are we seen as workflow tool or just editing tool?

**Scoring:**
- **High Capability Fit (9-10):** Leverages existing tech/data, strengthens brand
- **Medium Fit (6-8):** Requires some new capabilities, neutral brand impact
- **Low Fit (1-5):** Requires significant new capabilities, brand stretch

**Example Evaluation:**
- **Gallery Delivery:** High Capability Fit (9/10)
  - ✅ Already have photos in cloud
  - ✅ Can leverage AI for segmentation
  - ✅ Natural extension of editing workflow
  - ⚠️ Need gallery UI/UX (new but manageable)

- **CRM/Booking System:** Low Capability Fit (4/10)
  - ❌ No existing CRM capabilities
  - ❌ No booking/contract management
  - ❌ Brand stretch (not seen as business tool)
  - ❌ Significant new development required
